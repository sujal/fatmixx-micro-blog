		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Let&rsquo;s start this post by sharing an embarrassing fact: between leaving Disney in early 2022 and leaving Ohai in late 2024, I have gained about 28lbs (about 12kg). This wasn&rsquo;t a new trajectory - going back to the beginning of 2021, I&rsquo;ve put on 40ish pounds. By January 2024, I was a very unhealthy weight and just plain unfit.</p>
<p>My checkup with my doctor at the beginning of the year raised some alarms. I was at risk of being diagnosed as <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/diabetes/prediabetes">pre-diabetic</a>. My blood pressure was starting to wobble higher from its normally consistent healthy level. I wanted none of this future and began making changes. My weight leveled off, but I was unable to really get it moving downward consistently, or improve my energy levels. Eventually, I started feeling crummy &amp; unhappy<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> which led me to execute the reset I should’ve done back in 2022.</p>
<p>As part of the reset, I’ve incorporated using a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) to help track my blood sugar. CGMs are most often associated with diabetics who want to avoid the annoyance of finger pricks to monitor their blood sugar. These days, though, CGMs are also being <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sports/olympics/why-are-top-athletes-using-diabetes-tech-pursuit-medals-2024-06-10/">used by athletes to optimize training and performance</a>. These little coin-sized sensors provide insights more difficult to capture from other biosensors. There are also a few startups built around these non-diabetes uses, for example <a href="https://www.levels.com/">Levels</a>.</p>
<p>I’m not a high performance athlete, but I still wanted a CGM. My initial goal was really simple: I was determined to lower my average glucose level and knock down my <a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diagnostic-tests/a1c-test">A1C</a> before my follow-up exam this month (December 2024). I was also curious if it would help me gain insights into some occasional bouts of fatigue that didn’t seem tied directly to sleep quality.</p>
<p>Over the summer, a new CGM hit the market that didn&rsquo;t require a prescription: <a href="https://www.stelo.com">Stelo</a>. Stelo is made by Dexcom, makers of a <a href="https://www.dexcom.com/g7-cgm-system">popular CGM</a> for diabetics, so they know how to build these sensors. The device costs between $84-$99/month, depending on the length of your subscription. They offer a single purchase (w/o subscription) and 1- and 3-month subscriptions. They can be expensed to your FSA/HSA if you want.</p>
<p>I started using Stelo in September. Attaching the sensor is painless. The “needle” part of the sensor is super thin. I’ve never felt it go in in the 6 times I’ve replaced the sensor. It’s more painful removing the sensor - the adhesive is basically like pulling a bandage off. The sensor uses bluetooth to share data to my phone, which then records it in the background, (optionally) sharing it with the Apple Health app. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> The sensor takes about 30 minutes to warm up/calibrate, and then you get readings every minute that get pushed to your phone periodically - usually within 5 minutes, but sometimes a bit longer. Each sensor will last 2 weeks, and the app will notify you when it’s time to replace it. It also manages a grace period so you have time to replace it when convenient.</p>
<p>The app has some rough edges and bugs, but works well enough. The app will trigger a notification when it detects a blood sugar spike (i.e. a significant change in levels, which can be the normal result of eating or a heavy workout). Tapping on the notification will offer you the option to log anything that happened around the spike - meals, exercise, a stressful event, or other notes. There are weekly insights, tips for managing blood sugar, and a few other things in the app, but I basically live on its home screen, which shows the most recent readings and a graph of the last 3, 6, 12, or 24 hours.</p>
<p>In the three months I’ve had it, I’ve basically learned that everything my doctor has been gently encouraging me to do really has measurable, direct effects on my blood sugar and, more importantly, how I feel.</p>
<p>I know what you’re thinking: I’m an idiot for not realizing this (or listening to my doctor). I’ll concede you have a point, but in my defense the sensor described the magnitude of the changes I needed to make, and the consistency with which I needed to implement them. Before, I fell into the trap of sort of making changes without doing anywhere near enough. The little real-time reminders, tied to real data about my specific body and choices I made that day - not just a timer that says “drink more water!” or whatever - created a perspective shift for me that registered deeper than anything else I had heard or tried to that point.</p>
<p>So, what have I learned since starting with the sensor?</p>
<p>First, the difference between sedentary and even a small amount of daily movement is significant. Even a short walk after a meal can curb a glucose spike that might trigger fatigue for me. A more intense workout, e.g. a 30-minute Peloton ride or strength workout, will lower my average blood glucose for the rest of the day. A consistent schedule of daily movement, even if it’s just leisurely walking, was the key to a sustained reduction in my average blood glucose.</p>
<p>None of this should be a surprise - it’s why Oura and Apple both have step counts or activity goals in their basic feature set. The nice thing is that I could see when my body needed the workout, which made it easier to stay motivated and make adjustments if my meeting schedule or family schedule prevented a workout or a healthy meal.</p>
<p>I was also able to see a correlation between food and the afternoon waves of fatigue that would hit on some days. There’s more I need to track there before I can share more conclusions, but there’s a pattern there that I’m now mapping to <a href="https://blog.myfitnesspal.com/essential-guide-macros/">tracked macros</a> for each meal. I’m removing carb-heavy quick options (e.g. grabbing a bagel) for busy days and incorporating more of the protein-rich salads I used to eat daily at ESPN’s cafeteria pre-pandemic. Those are just two examples of several significant tweaks I’ve basically measured my way into. These changes are more recent (in the last month), but they’ve been working out really well so far.</p>
<p>I’ve got a long road ahead of me, especially as I ramp back up into full-time hours over the coming weeks. I lost a ton of weight back in 2009-2010 - nearly 80lbs (36kg) over 18 months or so. I’ve done this before, and know it can be done without all of this technology attached. That weight loss journey was before kids and before I was a senior executive with a large team, though. <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> The demands on my time are greater and more varied these days. The tech helps me follow a plan I can sustain <em>and adapt</em> going forward, no matter where my career or family life goes.</p>
<p>In that way, the data has been a major catalyst for my health. The cumulative effect of the perspective shift, along with the smaller, weekly tweaks to sleep and diet, has been fairly dramatic: more consistent energy levels, better workouts, and my weight is finally dropping now. Oh, and my blood sugar labs and blood pressure were much better this most recent checkup, a big victory. It’s been worth it for me so far.</p>
<p>I may stop using the Stelo in the spring unless I get back into longer-distance cycling or running again, where the data could help shape the rides/runs. I do want to get back into both by next summer, if my body is up for it. If all goes to plan, I should be facing that decision in the spring. Wish me luck!</p>
<h3 id="tips--tricks-for-stelo">Tips &amp; Tricks for Stelo</h3>
<p>Here are some notes for things I’ve learned over the last few months. I’ll keep this updated as I learn more.</p>
<ol>
<li>Shave your arm where you want to attach the sensor, especially if you have hairy arms. My first sensor was fine, but with my second one, the adhesive overpatch didn’t last the full two weeks. Since shaving my upper arm, I’ve had no issues. Few people will see that part of your arm, in case you’re worried about aesthetics.</li>
<li>I found using something like the <a href="https://trynood.com/products/the-eraser">Nood Eraser</a> easier than a razor on that part of my arm.</li>
<li>Some folks also suggest prepping the area with <a href="https://amzn.to/4fX2tWN">SkinTac</a> to help adhesion, but I haven’t needed it after shaving.</li>
<li>I do use the opposite product, <a href="https://amzn.to/3BaWY7T">TacAway</a> to clean up the adhesive residue left behind by the sensor when I swap it out. Just wait for it to evaporate before inserting the new sensor.</li>
<li>Buy a pack of overpatches in case you do have one come off for some reason - an intense workout, tight clothes that peel up the edges, or whatever. Best to have them on hand for an emergency. You can <a href="https://amzn.to/4gtTVq3">find them at Amazon</a>, of course, but your local pharmacy probably has them. When my second sensor’s overpatch came off, I was able to pick up compatible patches at my local CVS.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://preventivehealth.ai">nutritionist/lifestyle coach</a> I’m working with warned me that CGMs can be somewhat inconsistent from one two week period to the next. They’re useful as directional guidance vs getting too worked about the specific level, at least between two different sensor periods. I have seen this in practice. If you need to be sure, you can pick up a blood prick sensor and see what the variation is. Those tend to be much more accurate, even amongst different manufacturers. I haven’t gone that far - for me the goal is the notification from Apple Health letting me know there’s a new baseline for my average blood glucose levels.</li>

<p>Imagine being tired all the time, with too much to do at work (startup life!), and feeling like everyone had demands of your time. In hindsight, I was on a trajectory to burn out by the end of the year. I&rsquo;m glad the team I worked with helped us make adjustments to help and then eventually worked with me to plan an exit so I could execute a reset.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>If you’re working with nutritionists or doctors who have EMR systems connected to Apple Health, that can give them near real-time access to readings. It’s pretty handy.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>The words of <a href="https://hbr.org/2001/01/the-making-of-a-corporate-athlete">The Making of a Corporate Athlete</a> ring so true. Sheila, our CEO at <a href="https://www.ohai.ai">Ohai</a>, shared that article with all of us early in the Ohai/Proof of Learn days, to her credit (we really did have a good culture from that standpoint, a lesson I will carry forward). It is a personal regret that I didn’t take even stronger steps to put a rigorous fitness plan in place before the most intense months of the Ohai work. I was still running a bit and eating somewhat well, but not enough to counter the effects of a MUCH more sedentary lifestyle working from home combined with getting older.&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s appropriate that I should revive this site for the first time in years to post about politics, I guess. We are entering dangerous waters as a nation. That&rsquo;s why Bezos&rsquo;s decision and editorial this past week was one more disappointment on top of so many others. I was sketching out an articulation of why the piece bothered me even more than the LA Times situation. Luckily for you you don&rsquo;t need to read my writing. Casey Newton wrote a wonderful piece on the issue, which you should go read. It&rsquo;s spot on - Jeff Bezos is stuck at Day 2 with the Post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yesterday, I explored how billionaires are thinking about their relationships with Donald Trump on the eve of the election. Just before I hit send, Amazon founder and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos responded to criticism that he had prevented his editorial board from publishing its endorsement of Kamala Harris. It’s a piece of writing notable for how dated its thinking is for a famously forward-thinking entrepreneur. And to borrow a phrase from Amazon, it’s a recipe for a media industry that remains stuck squarely in Day 2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Worth reading the whole thing. The &ldquo;view from nowhere&rdquo; is poison when more and more audiences are turning to social media, clearly partisan voices, and spaces devoid of any cognitive dissonance. Of course faux neutral is not going to help.</p>

			 <p><strong>Update:</strong> There aren&rsquo;t APIs for most of the services that I&rsquo;d want to use here, so I&rsquo;m putting this project on pause for now. I&rsquo;ll probably hack something together for my own use, but trying to turn this into a service doesn&rsquo;t seem possible given API usage guidelines from these services.</p>
<hr>
<p>I posted the following to Twitter the other day:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, if all goes according to plan, all of my Twitter history up to yesterday-ish will be deleted, and I will have setup some code (that I control) that will delete everything older than 7 days on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>I used to believe that everything posted on the Internet should stay, forever. I’m not so sure that is true. Published for public consumption, forever? Beginning to doubt that for most normal humans…</p>
<p>In the near future (weeks hopefully), I’m going to start automatically hiding old photos, blog posts, everything except those that seem really worthwhile to keep up indefinitely. I’m working on the rules still, curious what people think are good rules.</p>
<p>I’m almost certain that corporate social media policies, especially for public facing employees, should strongly recommend services that do the same - either delete or tighten up permissions after a window of time on public posts (And anything on FB)…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, in short - you&rsquo;re only going to see ~7 days of old tweets on my Twitter account. This post is about how I&rsquo;m setting that up.</p>
<h2 id="the-short-term-hack">The short term hack</h2>
<p>Twitter makes this hard (though I think this is unintentional). Specifically, they make it hard to access anything more than the last 3200 tweets in your account via the API. So, getting your account down to just the last 7 days ends up requiring two bits of software:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find a way to delete tweets older than my most recent 3200.</li>
<li>Setup a process that watches my twitter feed regularly and deletes tweets older than 7 (or whatever) days.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="deleting-all-of-my-tweets">Deleting all of my tweets</h3>
<p>I decided I would delete all of my tweets to begin with. If twitter offered a native “archive” or unpublish option, a la Instagram, I may not have deleted everything. But they don’t, so this was my only option to start with a clean slate. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>I found a small script someone wrote on Github, forked it, and then modified it quite significantly. The script and instructions are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->on my Github account<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. You’ll need to be comfortable at the command line if you want to use it. It’s rough, and I offer no guarantees that it will run smoothly for you. Also, keep in mind - it will delete <!-- raw HTML omitted -->all<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of your tweets, and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->there is no undo<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Keep your backup archive safe, and make sure this is what you want: delete <!-- raw HTML omitted -->everything<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>To get around the 3200 tweet API issue mentioned above, the script uses the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tweets.js<!-- raw HTML omitted --> file that comes in the data backup from Twitter, so the good thing is that you’re basically forced to download the backup to use the utility. That file contains the IDs for all of your tweets (among other things), which is all we need to issue the delete command for that tweet.</p>
<h3 id="the-ongoing-culling-of-my-older-tweets">The ongoing culling of my older tweets</h3>
<p>Again, I started with someone else’s code. I found a nice little project written in Go that leveraged AWS Lambda to run the little bot. I used this project as a chance to brush up on my Cloud Formation skills, as well. My fork, with CloudFormation templates, is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->on my Github account<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as well. There’s even a handy “Launch Stack” button if you want to set it up on your own AWS account.</p>
<p>The bot runs every few hours, looks for tweets in my account older than the interval I’ve configured, currently set at 7 days, and deletes them if it finds anything. It’s all pretty simple.</p>
<h2 id="making-this-a-thing">Making this a thing</h2>
<p>As I started working through this, I starting thinking about enabling this for the other social media services I use. I don’t know why everything, from Flickr to Pinboard don’t offer ephemerality as a feature. If the feature is offered, it should be the default. As I mentioned at the start, I don’t believe we, as people, are prepared for a world with total recall of our every utterance. My thoughts on this are complicated,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> but suffice to say, I am going to build tools that allow me to manage my social media presence following these guidelines.</p>
<p>I mentioned this to a few folks, and got a few enthusiastic “I want that for my account!” comments. So, I’m going to spin this up as a side project and see what I can cobble together. If you take a look at the code I linked to above, it’s very simplistic - fine for a single account, but not the best for a real service.</p>
<p>The other aspect of this I’m working on is governance. I don’t want to do this as a business - that’s not a goal. What I do want is a service that has a strong privacy stance, that offers high trust to folks that use it. One of the reasons I didn’t use the public services that are out there is that their business model is unclear. <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>I am hoping to use this as an experiment in a cooperative form of governance for an online service, one where any charges are transparently used to maintain the service, where the source code is available for people to review, and where users can have some sort of assurance that the code that is released is the code that the hosted service is actually running. These seem like interesting problems regardless of the service being offered.</p>
<p>Because naming things is easily the most important and most fun part of any project (seriously, I have so many domain names!), I’ve decided to call this the Time Fades Project. A placeholder page is all that’s over there, but stay tuned for more.</p>
<p>If you have any interest in this sort of governance topic, or in contributing to the service, or in what a good set of default rules are for these sorts of ephemeral behaviors (I expect this will need to be different for different social networks), please get in touch.</p>

<p>I didn’t feel too bad about this, because I had an out. As part of this process, I had to download my official twitter data archive, which has everything.

<p>I&rsquo;m contemplating starting a project with a friend or two to replace the most valuable (to me) function of FB - as a clearinghouse for keeping up with your friends &amp; family.

			 <p>By most accounts, American Football<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> started out with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_American_football">humble beginnings</a>: a college sport that branched off association football (rugby) that spawned a bunch of disorganized professional organizations that eventually coalesced into the NFL and the college football behemoths we know about today.</p>
<p>The game started in the mid 1800s. The first professional game was in the 1890s, with the first player getting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Heffelfinger">a secret single game contract</a> that paid him $500 (a staggering $13,000 in 2016 dollars). By 1920, what would be the NFL was born. Players were <a href="https://books.google.co.in/books?id=DHBujbvNV1AC&amp;pg=PA97&amp;lpg=PA97&amp;dq=1920+nfl+salaries&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0-xSC1JeuZ&amp;sig=twf7YJqLs44yhpNFvTiu4rZKN68&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwigi_fR1pDLAhXBkY4KHShSD8YQ6AEITDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=1920%20nfl%20salaries&amp;f=false">averaging a few thousand dollars a year</a> ($27K in 2016 dollars) by the 30s and often took second jobs to make ends meet. By the 70s, the modern game and the college game began to take the form we see today. The rest you know: Billions of dollars and a billion fans watching for it’s marquee event.</p>
<h3 id="parallels">Parallels</h3>
<p>In the late 90s, a new genre of competition now called MOBAs (multiplayer online battle arena) came to be. Derived from a popular real time strategy game, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarCraft">Starcraft</a>, it has since spawned a growing industry of games in that genre. A few games, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Legends">League of Legends</a> (LoL) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dota_2">Dota 2</a>, have tournaments with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Legends_World_Championship">million dollar prizes</a>. They have <a href="http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/community/university/university-league-legends">college clubs around the world</a>, including at a few you may have <a href="https://www.facebook.com/harvardesports/">heard of</a>. They even have <a href="http://www.businessinsider.in/Theres-an-Adderall-doping-scandal-in-the-world-of-professional-gaming/articleshow/48194463.cms">their own doping</a> problems.</p>
<h3 id="discovery">Discovery</h3>
<p>ESPN <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/gaming/2014/07/17/espn-dota/12792079/">streamed a Dota 2 tournament</a> in 2015 and even broadcast a <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/2015/4/27/8502649/heroes-of-the-dorm-storm-blizzard-espn2-esports-arizona-state-cal-video-games">MOBA on ESPN2 last year</a>. Hard core sports fans were <a href="http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/04/espn-esports-heroes-of-the-dorm-reaction">less than impressed</a>.</p>
<p>I admit, I also was a little confused why a game I personally had never heard of, let alone played, was worth broadcasting on TV. Being me, that meant I started doing my research: learned about big prizes and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/31/technology/esports-explosion-brings-opportunity-riches-for-video-gamers.html">huge audiences</a>, read about the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/20/technology/league-of-legends-south-korea-epicenter-esports.html?_r=0">massive popularity of eSports in Korea</a>, and looked at the games themselves.</p>
<p>That these games are the popular tournament ones makes sense to me. I used to <em>love</em> RTS games back in the day<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. These RTS games are the predecessor to LoL, Dota 2, and Vainglory. MOBAs still share a lot in common with their ancestors. These games are a mix of:</p>
<ul>
<li>pure reflex and physical skill</li>
<li>complex strategy carried out on a deceptively simple field</li>
<li>clear, easy to understand objectives</li>
</ul>
<p>Actually, kind of like the NFL.</p>
<p>In other words, if you don’t play, you can still tell what’s going on at a basic level (kill the other team, take an objective). But if you play… wow, there are layers to unfold and strategies to debate and technique to admire.</p>
<p>I don’t play Dota or LoL, which is why a single Dota 2 broadcast couldn’t keep my attention for the whole event. I thought it was cool, recognized the RTS heritage, and basically went back to watching sports.</p>
<h3 id="revelation">Revelation</h3>
<p>One day, I picked up <a href="http://vainglorygame.com">Vainglory</a>. It’s a free MOBA for iOS which was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ChOe6dIJHw">featured during an Apple event</a>. I dove in and immediately was hooked. I wrote about Vainglory (indirectly) <a href="https://fatmixx.com/2015/04/12/an-ipad-a-mac-and-a-twitch-tv/">last year</a>. At that time, I had been playing the game frequently for months, so now (except for a couple month hiatus around the birth of my daughter) I’ve been playing this game for over a year. I literally play a round most nights before I head to bed.</p>
<p>I’m naturally competitive, and so naturally I want to be good at this game… Which is when the whole thing finally clicked.</p>
<p>In the Twitch post, I likened watching Twitch to the Golf Network. Boring if you’re not a golfer, but a great source of tips and help if you are. This is true of the entire community around video gaming now. For example, I’ve been watching videos on YouTube like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIQU7Yn_UbA">BenTimm1’s videos</a> to learn strategy and tactics. Tournaments are often streamed on <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/vainglory/profile">Twitch.tv</a>, so that’s another good resource.</p>
<p>Vainglory also has televised tournaments in Korea. The <a href="http://www.vainglorygame.com/news/vipl_broadcastschedule/">Vainglory IPL</a> is broadcast on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OGN_(TV_channel)">OGN</a>, &ldquo;a South Korean cable television channel that specializes in broadcasting video game-related content and eSports matches.&rdquo; Here’s one of their broadcasts of a Vainglory IPL final:</p>
<p>Those are pretty good production values, which isn&rsquo;t very surprising given the popularity of eSports in Korea. You can see a huge improvement, though, as each subsequent tournament is streamed. There&rsquo;s a big improvement in the commentary, for example, even from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y88KJjJFvok&amp;list=PLvEkgn9uepVSRAoWa570Z-nuxCdwe2uW-&amp;index=1">the Vainglory World Invitational final</a>, which took place right before the IPL tournament embedded above.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to note that this is for Vainglory, a relative newcomer to the MOBA and eSports world. Take everything I&rsquo;ve said above and amplify it for LoL or Dota 2. This is a shot from Wikipedia of the Dota 2 finals crowd in Seattle:</p>

<h3 id="legitimacy">Legitimacy</h3>
<p>While the Great Depression hurt the growth of the NFL, it did provide one benefit: it convinced otherwise respectable men to turn to football as a primary source of income. These were college educated men, <a href="https://books.google.co.in/books?id=DHBujbvNV1AC&amp;pg=PA179&amp;lpg=PA179&amp;dq=white+collar+families+nfl+1920s&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0-xSC7IeC_&amp;sig=Reb6exu-vAtJxRGGEDnFxWOpKJE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiN0uHdspLLAhWDA44KHcpsDzwQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=white%20collar%20families%20nfl%201920s&amp;f=false">disproportionately from white collar families</a> who probably would&rsquo;ve pursued other opportunities. This raised the talent level, making the league stronger and likely creating a feedback loop<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Vainglory, my favorite, is still small, paying out 10s of thousands for their grand prizes. Dota 2 <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/valve-is-making-worlds-best-dota-2-players-into-millionaires/">has much higher payouts and an enormous prize pool</a>. LoL is further along in their growth, and their tournaments provide a sense of where things are going. Riot Games, makers of League of Legends, provides <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/playbook/tech/post/_/id/1541/league-of-legends-esports-growing">salaries for their tournament players</a> along with travel stipends. Make the choice to leap into professional eSports easier and the talent should follow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All of that combined makes being a professional “League of Legends” player a viable career opportunity. This helps the game reach its full potential, because we want to avoid our pro players coming under financial stress and having to hold down part-time jobs. We want to make it so being a pro player is a completely viable career opportunity. <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/playbook/tech/post/_/id/1541/league-of-legends-esports-growing">Riot Games' CEO, Brandon Beck</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s still not huge money. With sponsors involved, some of these players are making a decent living, even if they need to also have a side job. Kind of like the early NFL.</p>
<h3 id="prediction">Prediction</h3>
<p>The big MOBAs are growing the infrastructure around eSports in a way that points to a sustainable future. There are campus organizations forming along with amateur associations. There’s also more mainstream acceptance of gaming thanks to smartphones, and thus a bigger potential audience. The choice to play competitively is getting easier to make for players. Those trends just need to continue in the same direction, and eSports could be a huge thing. Maybe… kind of like the NFL.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t find too many sources aside from that one book (which I only have the Google excerpts for - it&rsquo;s out of print, it seems). The draft came to be toward the end of the Depression and pre-WWII, which could correlate. It&rsquo;s unclear (to me, right now) if the draft initially was because of an abundance of potential players or a way to entice players in. Worth doing more reading around this.&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Compare it to, say, Inman Square in Cambridge, Mass.: It would not do in BBS to have buses passing right through and stopping right in front of the Cheesecake Factory, if those buses ran a route that included, say, the local district court and jail, and nearby housing projects. Nor would it do to have upscale boutiques interspersed with dollar stores and appliance repair stores and bodegas, the way you might see in a secondary commercial center in Brooklyn, like 5th Avenue in Sunset Park, or even on Manhattan’s Upper East Side.</p>

<p>The Town of West Hartford paid nearly $3 million in overtime compensation in 2010 to police and fire department personnel, according to data released under a Freedom of Information request.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Town administrators this year combed through expenses, trimming nearly $1 million from the original proposed budget before approving a 2012-13 spending plan. But in trying to cut, administrators lack the power to control specific items, such as overtime paid to union employees.</p>

<p>In West Hartford this week, when the electric company was refusing to tell town leaders what streets its crews were going to be working on, officials came up with their own improvised solution. Municipal leaders sent town police over to CL&amp;P&rsquo;s staging area at Westfarms mall in the evening to ask the crews themselves where they would be heading to work the next day.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t neurotic small town bureaucrats overreacting. This information is critical during an emergency, when fire and rescue personnel must know what streets are passable. Already, one elderly West Hartford woman without power died in a fire at her home this week.</p>
<p>So what did CL&amp;P do when they found out West Hartford police were tracking down where crews were going to work?</p>
<p>They told their workers not to talk to the cops. Now there&rsquo;s a company that cares.</p>

			 <p>I attend each <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Connecticut Forum<!-- raw HTML omitted --> event hoping to leave smarter than when I arrive. This is usually a slam dunk, no doubt it&rsquo;ll happen thing for any given Forum event. Except, that is, for last night.</p>
<p>The topic was <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Our Great Education Challenge<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The panel consisted of:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It helps, at this point, to be familiar with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Waiting for Superman<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. If you haven&rsquo;t seen the movie, you can quickly read <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my review of the film<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Short version: the film concludes unions are at the heart of America&rsquo;s education problem because they prevent principals and schools from coaching, firing, or adequately managing teachers.</p>
<p>As it turns out, every person on the panel (plus the moderator) basically took the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Superman<!-- raw HTML omitted --> position as a given except Lily Eskelsen (the sole union perspective on the panel). This is unsurprising considering their backgrounds - two are school administrators who spar with unions constantly. Guggenheim obviously agrees with his own film. Excluding Schnur, then, you have the makings of a pile on for Eskelsen. So, that&rsquo;s essentially what we got. The entire Forum consisted of the panelists delivering applause lines ripping on the unions or going back and forth with Eskelsen.</p>
<p>It would&rsquo;ve been more productive to talk about specific union concessions that would make school improvements easier, or to discuss whether the union even has a purpose in today&rsquo;s school system. I&rsquo;d be interested in understanding why only 17% of charter schools perform better than public schools, or why Joel Klein thinks that&rsquo;s a success rate worth &ldquo;cherishing.&rdquo; Or, why Deborah Gist thinks school systems would negotiate these weird, applause line worthy rules into their teacher contracts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that I believe these people are playing fast and loose with the numbers, or have some hidden agenda. In fact, I believe they have sound reasons for their perspectives (and they wear their agendas pretty plainly out in the open). I just think they&rsquo;re used to talking about this topic with other educators and school reformers. So, they mention things like &ldquo;alternative evaluation systems&rdquo; without explaining what that means because, well, everyone on the panel knows.</p>
<p>This seems like a flaw in the Forum format. The moderators are often prepared to discuss the issues and to facilitate conversation among the panel, but not so much to facilitate understanding for the audience. It&rsquo;s really a missed opportunity. I would love a moderator who worked to get panelists to explain terms or concepts that may not be obvious to non-experts.</p>
<p>For example, teacher evaluation was a key topic of discussion. During the Forum, Eskelsen brought up concerns with using test scores as a sole measure of teacher effectiveness. A number of panelists mentioned that some districts were testing alternative and more comprehensive teacher evaluation systems. No one, however, ever bothered to explain what some of them are or what else they look at beyond a standardized test. I was really curious about that and felt let down when the topics shifted.</p>
<p>My other takeaway from the forum was that there were lots of anecdotes or quips that highlighted some ridiculous policy or other that everyone universally could hate or be amused by. Applause lines, if you will. Last night, I called it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sloganeering<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. That still seems like the best description of last night&rsquo;s conversation.</p>
<p>For example, at one point, Norah O&rsquo;Donnell turned to the audience and called teachers heroes who have a tough job and work very hard. Its the constant refrain, didn&rsquo;t seem particularly sincere. Mere minutes later, a panelist cracks a joke about teachers leaving at 3PM even though their schools are failing. Well, which one is it? There&rsquo;s a weird sort of contradiction that comes up in education reform conversations. Teachers are both working really hard and lazy, overpaid and underpaid, and so on. Doesn&rsquo;t really help the conversation.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I walked away with the same questions I had at the end of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Superman<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which was disappointing. There was one exception, though. During the audience Q&amp;A portion, O&rsquo;Donnell asked a question I submitted about class size (cool!). Joel Klein pointed out that one of the Harlem charters has 30 kids in some classes. Eskelsen pointed out that she&rsquo;s taught up to 39 in one. Pretty big difference, and one reason I remain skeptical that firing teachers has anything to do with charter success.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping we can continue this discussion in the coming weeks among ourselves. I have some ideas on how to bring this conversation along, and I want to start by looking at some of the questions I asked in my review of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Superman<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I also have a bunch of questions jotted down in my notes from the Forum last night. Between the two, there are a lot of items worth a follow up. On that front, the Forum was a rousing success.</p>
